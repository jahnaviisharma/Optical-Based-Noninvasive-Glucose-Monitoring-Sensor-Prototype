##  Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **noninvasive glucose monitoring sensor prototype** using **Near-Infrared (NIR) sensing** and **photodetectors**.  
The system estimates glucose concentration based on skin absorption properties, aiming to provide a **painless, blood-free, and continuous glucose monitoring solution** for diabetic patients.

---

##  Motivation
- Diabetes patients require frequent glucose checks, which are often invasive and painful.  
- Noninvasive monitoring can improve comfort, compliance, and accessibility.  
- Optical sensing provides a promising alternative to finger-prick testing.  

---

##  Key Features
- **Optical Sensing:** NIR LEDs and photodetectors capture skin absorption signals.  
- **Arduino Integration:** Real-time signal acquisition via Arduino board.  
- **Signal Processing:** Preprocessing, filtering, and feature extraction using Python.  
- **Prototype Design:** Portable and modular for easy calibration and scaling.  

---

##  Technology Stack
- **Hardware:** Arduino Uno, NIR LEDs, Photodetectors, Signal Conditioning Circuit  
- **Software:** Arduino IDE, Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)  
- **Techniques:** Signal filtering, noise reduction, calibration modeling
